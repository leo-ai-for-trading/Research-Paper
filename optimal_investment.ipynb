The time-varying extreme values for the ambiguity in the risk premium on the bond can lead to switching worst-case parameters over time, which leads in turn to a nondifferentiable value function. Since the implementation of the optimal investment strategy in Section 4 shows that Assumption 3.1 corresponds to typical market situations, the focus of the analysis lies on a region of the state space where the investment problem offers a closed-form solution, providing insights into the structure of the optimal investment strategy.\n",

    "which is referred to as the hedge portfolio, since it hedges interest rate risk using only the bond, as in the classical situation without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the investor does not hedge ambiguity but only risk. Introducing ambiguity to the model does not lead to any additional funds compared to the case without ambiguity. This is in line with other studies on optimal investment with ambiguity and maxmin preferences $[4,27]$ but in contrast to the results of Flor and Larsen [15] and Maenhout [30], where ambiguity leads to an additional hedge term. The reason is that the preferences of the investor in the present study do not include any penalty term, which is added to the objective of the investor by Flor and Larsen [15] and Maenhout [30]. Therefore, the absence of additional hedge terms is due to the maxmin preferences of the investor, which do not create any demand for hedging ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, ambiguity only affects the speculative part of the investment, but it has no effect on hedging interest rate risk. The effect of the ambiguity is represented by the worst-case scenario $\\hat{\\theta}=\\left(\\underline{\\lambda}_B(t), \\underline{\\lambda}_S, \\bar{\\sigma}_r, \\bar{\\sigma}_S, \\underline{\\rho}\\right)_t$. So the investor considers the lowest possible risk premia, the highest possible volatilities, and the lowest possible correlation as the worst-case scenario among all relevant priors. The worst-case scenario only appears in the speculative portfolio, $\\pi^{\\text {myopic }}$. The hedge portfolio, $\\pi^{\\text {hedge }}$, is unaffected by the worst-case scenario. At first sight, this is surprising since the hedge portfolio is typically determined by the diffusion terms of the wealth and the state variable, respectivelywhich are ambiguous in this case. In principle (when deriving a candidate for the optimal investment strategy under a fixed scenario), the hedge portfolio in the optimal investment strategy depends on the (ambiguous) volatility of the short-term interest rate, but in the end, it always vanishes (no matter which scenario is considered by the investor). Thus, the hedge portfolio is only influenced by the function $b$, which scales the ambiguous volatility of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the exogenous sources of ambiguity, the endogenous ambiguity leads to an additional dynamic effect in the investment strategy. As in the case without ambiguity the investment strategy changes if the time horizon of the investor changes, which is an interesting feature, since it is intuitively reasonable but not present in classical dynamic asset allocation models. More specifically, if there is no ambiguity, the optimal investment strategy is given by $\\tilde{\\pi}^{\\top}=\\left(\\tilde{\\pi}_t^B, \\tilde{\\pi}_t^S\\right)_t$, where that is, the investor only considers the (constant) scenario $\\tilde{\\theta}=\\left(\\lambda_0^B, \\lambda_S, \\sigma_r, \\sigma_S, \\rho\\right)_t($ similar to the beginning of Section 2). Since everything else is constant, the dynamic behavior of the investment strategy is completely determined by the function $b$, which changes according to the time to maturity of the bond and how much time is left until the investor's time horizon. In the presence of ambiguity, the fixed parameters are replaced by their respective worst-case values (compare the investment strategies $\\tilde{\\pi}$ from above and $\\hat{\\pi}$ from Theorem 3.2). The worst-case values related to the exogenous ambiguity do not create any dynamic behavior, but the worst-case value for the ambiguous part in the risk premium on the bond, $\\underline{\\lambda}_B(t)$, changes over time, which creates an additional dynamic effect in addition to the (classical) effect induced by the function $b$."
